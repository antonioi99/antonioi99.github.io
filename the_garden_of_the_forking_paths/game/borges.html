    <h1>Jorge Luis Borges</h1>

    <h2>Who Was Borges?</h2>
    <p>
      Jorge Luis Borges (1899–1986) was an Argentine writer, essayist, and librarian known 
      for his erudition, philosophical depth, and imagination. Blind for much of his adult life, 
      Borges composed works that blend reality and fiction, logic and paradox, and literature and metaphysics.
    </p>
    <p>
      Borges rarely wrote novels. Instead, he crafted short stories—many of them 
      just a few pages long—that opened vast philosophical and narrative spaces. 
      His influences range from ancient metaphysics to modern science fiction, 
      and he was fascinated by language, time, identity, and infinity.
    </p>

    <h2>The Garden of Forking Paths</h2>
    <p>
      First published in 1941, <em>The Garden of Forking Paths</em> is one of Borges' 
      most celebrated stories. On the surface, it is a spy narrative set during World War I. 
      But beneath the plot lies a metaphysical meditation on time, choice, and multiple realities.
    </p>
    <p>
      The protagonist, Yu Tsun, is a Chinese spy working for the Germans. In an effort to convey a 
      secret message, he visits Dr. Stephen Albert, who explains that Yu Tsun’s ancestor, Ts’ui Pên, 
      created a novel and a labyrinth that are one and the same. In this “garden of forking paths,” 
      time is not linear: all choices, all outcomes, all realities exist simultaneously.
    </p>

    <h2>Reflections of Borges' Poetics</h2>
    <p>
      <em>The Garden of Forking Paths</em> encapsulates Borges’ core poetics:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Non-linearity of time:</strong> Time is not a straight line but a web of possibilities.</li>
      <li><strong>Labyrinths:</strong> Not just physical, but conceptual — structures that mirror the complexity of thought.</li>
      <li><strong>Intertextuality and fiction within fiction:</strong> The story includes a fictional book within the story that defines its own universe.</li>
      <li><strong>Infinity and multiplicity:</strong> The narrative explores how every moment branches into endless alternatives.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      In Borges’ view, literature is not merely a form of storytelling, but a way to think about thinking — a metaphysical game. 
      This story is both an elegant narrative and a deep philosophical riddle.

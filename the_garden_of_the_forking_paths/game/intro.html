              <p>However, you will have the possibility to choose everytime between different options that will define your own story, leading to a different end of the story.</p>
              <p></p>
              <p>The game style is rather simple:</p>

                <li>every step you take in your journey is associated with a different part of the story;</li>
                <li>you have the possibility to move in four directions by clicking on the bottoms on the left side;</li>
                <li>after you have choosen where to go the dot in the middle will move consequently and another part of the story will revealed to you;</li>
                <li>from time to time instead of moving in some direction you will be asked to choose between a couple of alternatives;</li>
                <li>the progress bar on the right show how far you are from a node called 'The point' from which different endings of the story are possible.</li>
              </ul> 
                <p>If you want to have a look at the structure of the story, you can click on "View the labyrinth map".</p>
